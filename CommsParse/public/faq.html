		<h3>Comms (Free Version)</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>What are public channels? Are they encrypted?</dt>
			<dd>Public channels are public forums and are not encrypted. They are readable by all users, whether logged into an account, or not. Anyone that is logged in can also post messages to these channels. Messages posted to public channels are anonymous, but NOT encrypted.</dd>
			<dt>Can I create multiple accounts?</dt>
			<dd>Absolutely. Go crazy. We are not Google.
			<dt>I have a great idea for a public channel. Can I add it?<dt>
			<dd>Not directly, but you can suggest that it be added by tapping the question mark icon in the upper right panel. We will consider the channel and add it if we like it.</dd>
			<dt>What happens when I "burn" my account?</dt>
			<dd>The username is deleted from our database. Any subscriptions for that user are deleted. If you have a Pro subscription, that will not be lost, but any encrypted messages sent to that user will be destroyed. The username you used will be available for anyone to reuse. See <i>plausible deniability.</i> We are not YouTube.</dd>
			<dt>What is included in a Pro subscription?</dt>
			<dd>You get all of the features from the Pro version of the app, including the ability to create hidden (non-public) channel and send and receive strongly-encrypted messages. The length of the subscription is determined by which in-app purchase you make.</dd>
			<dt>If I purchase a Pro subscription, will it automatically renew?</dt>
			<dd>No. We think you can make the decision to renew on your own.</dd>
			<dt>Can I have a free trial of the Pro features?</dt>
			<dd>We priced the one month subscription as low as Apple allows for an in-app purchase. However, if you want a day or two trial, email us with a good reason and we might set that up for you.</dd>
			<dt>Does the app include any advertising or collect information that is sold to advertisers?</dt>
			<dd>No. We are not Twitter.</dd>
			<dt>What is your privacy policy?</dt>
			<dd>We do not collect personally identifiable data. There are no advertisers to share it with. You are our customer, and we do not even know who you are.</dd>
			<dt>I just saw something posted in a public channel that is [offensive, mean, wrong, politically-incorrect]. What are you going to do about it?</dt>
			<dd>Most likely nothing. It's a public forum. If we happen to see something that is illegal, we may remove it, but typically we do not monitor or moderate the messages. We are not Facebook.</dd>
			<dt>I forgot my password, can you send it to me?</dt>
			<dd>We are sorry, but no. We don't know your password. We don't know your name or email either. In fact, without the password, there is no way to prove that you created that user account. Just go ahead and create a new one. They are free and unlimited.</dd>
			<dt>How long are messages kept?</dt>
			<dd>Currently, messages are kept for 14 days. This is subject to change.</dd>

		<h3>Comms Pro</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Does the Pro version do everything that the free version does?</dt>
			<dd>Yes. Read through the section to the left. Obviously, the Pro version does not have in-app purchases, as you already have all of the Pro features included.</dd>
			<dt>How secure is your encryption?</dt>
			<dd>Encrypted messages use ElGamal asynchronous public-private key encryption using libgcrypt, a trusted, open source encryption library. The public key is made available to other users in order to encrypt messages sent to you. The private key is stored in your phone's secure keychain and does not leave the device. While no encryption is perfect or guaranteed, it is currently thought that the computing power required to decrypt this encryption is impractical. Think "finding a needle in a stack of needles." If and when the day comes where it is thought to be insecure, we will either replace the encryption or shut the system down.</dd>
			<dt>What does the lock and key icon mean in the channel list? And on a message?</dt>
			<dd>The lock icon on the channel list means that the channel is hidden and the messages posted to it are encrypted. Only users that know the channel name can join. The lock icon on a message similarly means that the message has been encrypted.</dd>
			<dt>How do I send encrypted messages?</dt>
			<dd>First, tap the "Create or Join a Hidden Channel" button at the bottom of the screen. Once created, you will be taken into that channel. The number of subscribers (including yourself) will be listed at the top of the screen. Inviting other users to join your hidden channel is best performed offline, in person, or through other trusted methods. Once the other users have joined the channel, each subscribe user will receive the encrypted messages posted. You will not be able to view messages posted prior to subscribing, or after unsubscribing.</dd>
			<dt>How do I really know who is in a "hidden" channel?</dt>
			<dd>The number of users in a hidden channel are displayed. Remember, Comms and Comms Pro is an anonymous system. Automated authentication and verification leads to identification of users, and we chose not to do that. The coordination of meeting in a hidden channel happens outside of the system, preferably offline completely.</dd>
			<dt>How long are "hidden" channels kept?</dt>
			<dd>Hidden channels are kept until there are no more subscribers, then they are deleted along with all of the messages they contained. The channel name then becomes available to be reused.</dd>
			<dt>If I opt into receiving push notifications, doesn't that identify me?</dt>
			<dd>No. We receive a unique "device token" that we use to send push notifications through Apple's Push Notification Servers. This device token is created after the app is running on your phone and is unique for this app and fairly random. The push notifications never contain any data about your user account, the messages posted, or even to which channels you are subscribed. It is only a mechanism to notify you that a new message has been posted to a subscribed channel. If you are paranoid, turn off push notifications. Doing so will prevent channels from automatically refreshing new messages, but will otherwise work fine.</dd>
			<dt>What does [unable to decrypt data] mean?</dt>
			<dd>Well, we thought that message made sense on its own. But it is likely caused by logging into the same account from different devices or from removing and reinstalling the app on the same device. You see, the private key required to decrypt the message is created at the time the user account is created. If you log into that account from another device, that device creates a new private key and updates your public key in our database. Only the device last used to log in will be able to decrypt subsequent messages. On the other hand, that new device will be unable to decrypt older messages sent to that user. Yes, we thought about making it possible to transfer the private keys from one installation to another, but every approach opened up a potential security hole and we opted against it.</dd>
			<dt>Won't bad guys use this app to break the law and hurt people?</dt>
			<dd>Yes. That will happen with or without this app. It is part of the cost of living in a free society under the Bill of Rights. Here at Comms, we value all of the Amendments.</dd>
			<dt>I am from [NSA, CIA, FBI, DHS, FEMA] and I demand your data.</dt>
			<dd>First of all, that is not a question. Secondly, we will comply with any properly served legal process that we are compelled to comply with. However, keep in mind that the encrypted messages are, well, encrypted. We do not have the private keys required to decrypt them. Also, we do not have any user account information aside from the username, and those are not traceable back to individuals since they are anonymous and can be created, destroyed, and reused. If you would like a copy of the unencrypted data, it might just be easier to install the Comms free edition. I do, however, recommend the one year Pro subscription if you want to further discuss the investigation.</dd>
			<dt>Does your app comply with the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security Export Administration Regulations? Specifically Category 5, Part 2 of the EAR? Do you have an Export Regulation Number (ERN)? Do you file an annual self-classification report? Has the app been assigned an ECCN number?</dt>
			<dd>Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And, yes.</dd>
